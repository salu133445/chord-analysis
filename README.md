# Music Chord Progression Analysis

Authors: Hao-Wen Dong and Chun-Jhen Lai

We aim to analyze the statistical properties of chords and chord progressions in
over ten thousand songs available on the HookTheory platform. In particular, we
are interested in analyzing the prior probabilities for different chords, the
transition probabilities between chords and chords and the most frequent chord
progressions. We are also interested in how these statistics differ from genre
to genre with an eye to reveal some interesting trends on the usage of chords
and chord progressions in different genres.
